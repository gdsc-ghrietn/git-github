2. `cd` (Change Directory):
    - To move forward (into a subdirectory):
      ```bash
      $ cd directory_name
      ```
    - To move backward (up one directory):
      ```bash
      $ cd ..
      ```
    - To move up two directories:
      ```bash
      $ cd ../..
      ```

3. `ls` (List): Lists the files and directories in the current directory.

    Example:
    ```bash
   $ ls
    file1.txt file2.txt directory1 directory2
    ```
